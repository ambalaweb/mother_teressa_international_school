<p>Our scientific progress has outrun our soiritual power. We have guided missiles and misguided men. It's the time we returned to our roots and seek solace in ages old traditional Yoga of body descippline and meditation. We take special care in producing syudents with sound belief in spirituality. It has become a fashion to abuse our civic duties, this is due to lack of understanding. The significance of being good citizens. We instill these civic duties in the mind of children right from the very beginning. We believe that practical knowhow is more important than theoretical knowlrdge. Thus we ensure full participation of students in mock activities symolizing the functioning of society.</p>
<p>Let's together build a new generation strong at heart, sharp ain mind, agile in action and rich in culture with an impervious spiritual base.</p>
